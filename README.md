# Chatex

Communicate between iex nodes using only the powers of Elixir and BEAM!

## How to use?

1. Initialize an iex instance with `iex -S mix`
2. Run `Chatex.CLI.start` and follow the instructions.

You have a few commands:

1. `/join <room>`: Joins or creates a room if it doesn't exist.
2. `/leave`: Leaves the current room, if one exists.
3. `/exit`: Closes the application.
